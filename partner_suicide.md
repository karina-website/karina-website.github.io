      <h2>Partner Suicide</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
    Did your partner kill him or herself and you are left alone to deal with everything? Life just seems so different now. So many contradictory feelings, so many layers.  When are you pretending? When are you being real? How can this be happening? You wonder--Could I have prevented this from happening? Why did they do this to me? This is so hard.

    Sometimes it’s so intense that’s nothing else matters. Sometimes you forget it happened and life seems normal. Sometimes you just want to stay in bed and do nothing. Sometimes, you want to pretend it never happened. How can I go on?

    Let’s sit together. Let’s do this together. Nothing will turn back time. Perhaps, it would be useful to have someone talk about this. Perhaps it would be useful to remember that your own feelings also matter. Call me.
