			<h2>Your first session:</h2>
		</header>
		<p>The first session is an opportunity to start knowing each other. We will sit together and talk about what the process of therapy looks like and what you can expect in the first few sessions. We will talk about logistics, such as phone numbers, contacting each other, scheduling,  fees and payment and so on. There will be small amount of paperwork to sign. </p>

		<p>My goal in the first session is to get to know you and what brought us together, what you think the problem or problems you are facing, and what you expect to get out our meetings together. Therapy is very personal process and, similar to other human relationships, and is very different for each particular relationship. The first session is exploratory is nature, so a lot of questions will be asked by both parties.</p>
