Karina is a systemic oriented therapist,  with a strong belief in the power of relationships. She is certified in ESFT, and practices attachment based, trauma informed approaches, to help singles, couples and family units  deal with anxiety, depression, defiant and aggressive behaviors, family conflict and relationship isues. She is fluent in both english and spanish.

Therapy is about learning about ones-self, growing as a person, and ultimately healing. In a safe, confidential, accepting and honest space. Together we'll work towards understanding what potential changes you can make to help deal with the issues you may be facing. 

Being part of therapy, be it for the first time or for the hundredth time, and be a daunting and anxiety riddled process. However, it is less scary than it first seems, and its often the first step towards a more meaningful life.
