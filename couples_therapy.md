      <h2>Couples Therapy: Embracing the Developmental Model</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
    Are you and your partner feeling disconnected? Do you find yourselves stuck in the same arguments, wondering if there’s a way to break the cycle? Are you wondering: How do we get back the intimacy we once had or we  dreamt we would have?  Can we strengthen our relationship without losing ourselves in the process?

    I specialize in helping couples like you navigate these questions and more through the Developmental Model of Couples Therapy. This approach is based on the understanding that relationships naturally evolve, and that partners grow both individually and together. By recognizing these stages of development, I can help you and your partner work through conflicts, transitions, and emotional barriers with greater compassion and success.

    What is the Developmental Model?

    The Developmental Model was created by Dr. Ellyn Bader and Dr. Peter Pearson. It focuses on the idea that healthy relationships require both individuality and togetherness. Couples often face challenges when one or both partners struggle to maintain their individuality while being part of a connected, intimate relationship. This model helps you understand where you and your partner are developmentally, identify areas of difficulty, and work toward a balanced, supportive partnership.
