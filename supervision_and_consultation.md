      <h2>Professional Supervision</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I am a  licensed Marriage and Family Therapist ( LMFT) with a systemic and experiential approach.  I offer supervision to professionals looking to develop and grow themselves as therapists and connect with other mindlike colleagues. 

    My work focuses on understanding the broader systems at play—within families, teams, and organizations—while incorporating experiential techniques that foster deeper self-awareness and emotional growth.

    In supervision, I provide:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Systemic and Experiential Guidance:</b> Helping professionals explore the interconnected relationships and dynamics,  including  also using experiential methods to enhance emotional insight and engagement.</li>
	<li><b>Ethical and Professional Oversight:</b> Ensuring that professionals maintain high ethical standards and best practices within their work.</li>
	<li><b>Reflective Feedback:</b> Offering personalized feedback that encourages both intellectual and emotional growth, connecting with personal creativity and addressing personal stuck areas when they are interfering in professional work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In addition to supervision, I provide consultation services to individuals, teams, and organizations. Using both systemic and experiential frameworks, I help clients gain a deeper understanding of the issues they face and provide effective, tailored solutions. I specialize in:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Strategic Problem-Solving:</b> Assisting clients in identifying underlying patterns within systems, and offering practical, experiential-based solutions that address emotional and relational dynamics.</li>
	<li> <b>Enhancing Leadership & Team Dynamics:</b> Working with teams to improve collaboration and communication through experiential techniques, while addressing systemic influences on team performance.</li>
	<li><b>Client-Centered Approach:</b> Prioritizing the well-being and unique needs of your clients or organization, with a vision on expanding ways of relating , punctuating strengths and taping on creativity and playfulness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If you’re looking for a supervisor or consultant who integrates both systemic and experiential approaches to foster deeper insight and lasting change, I’m here to support you.
